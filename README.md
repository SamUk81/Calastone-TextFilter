# Coding Rules
The rules of this coding assignment is to take multiple text filters and apply them to any given string.
There are three filters to apply to a given string:

1. Filter1 – filter out all the words that contains a vowel in the middle of the word – the centre 1 or 2 letters
("clean" middle is ‘e’, "what" middle is ‘ha’, "currently" middle is ‘e’ and should be filtered, "the", "rather"
should not be).
2. Filter2 – filter out words that have length less than 3.
3. Filter3 – filter out words that contains the letter ‘t’    

# Future Development
Develop error handling, logging and more test coverage.
